## Question 1

CSS allows you to assign a maximum or minimum size to an element. Give an
example of the use of each of the two options (giving a maximum size or a
minimum size to an element), briefly describing its operation.

### Answer 1 \*

*CSS* is capable of sizing elements (text, media, and so on) in a smart way.
Rather than having a fixed size set (which is also possible), it allows setting
a minimum and/or maximum size for a given element. Thus, it is possible to set
 `min-height`, `max-height`, `min-width` and `max-width` according to our needs.
In the case of `min-` sizes, we are telling *CSS* the **minimum** size that the
box where the element is displayed will have. Similarly, when using `max-`
sizes we are limiting the maximum size of the box where the content will be
displayed.

Let us consider an example for each of these properties:

![`min-` sizes example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/203520117-da9b6b77-2493-48fe-9660-73303bf53da7.png)

In this case, we are setting that the boxes will **at least** have a width and
height of `20px`. Both the `star` image and the `Hello` text need more than ``20px``
so *CSS* will provide the needed space for the boxes. The box with no content
in it displays only the box of `20x20px` since no extra space is needed to
display that element.

![`max-` sizes example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40824677/203523305-e914a73c-07d0-46d6-bca3-45f1c76b00af.png)

For this second example, we set a **maximum** width and height of `100px`. This
means that boxes can adjust their size according to the content displayed
in them, but never surpass the maximum limit. The `Hello` text and the empty
boxes both display with the necessary space, since they both need less than
`100px` to display their content, but the `star` image is larger than the
said maximum value. In this case, the content of the box will overflow. To
prevent issues like this, it may be a good idea to set the property
`overflow: auto;` in case our content doesn't fit a box with limited sizes.

## Question 2

### Question 2.1

Research the existing accessibility legislation in your country of residence.
In case there is no legislation in your country of residence, investigate the
USA legislation. What are the main rules that regulate it?

#### Answer 2.1

In Spain, there is some regulation of accessibility of websites, though there
appears to be no legislation according to the [W3C's Web Accessibility Laws & Policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/).
That site is to be updated in **November 2022** and the current data appears to
be from **2018**. Rather, this legislation is defined in the *BOE*
(Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado), in [this Royal Decree-Law](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-12699).
It generally dictates a set of rules to ensure accessibility for certain entities.
The decree aims to guarantee some accessibility so that people with disabilities
or the elderly can access websites and smartphone applications without discrimination.
This regulation is subject to the *Official Journal of the European Union*
(available [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html)),
the decree states, which releases further regulations that should be adopted by sites
and applications according to the new needs that arise.

### Question 2.2

Do a little planning for the accessibility of the website you are going to
create in Part 2 of this PEC. Take as a reference the section Implement
accessibility in your project, which you will find in Stage 6 of Unit 5.
You will have to answer questions such as:

- What alternative texts should the images have?
- If a user navigates through the links via the keyboard (using the tab key),
will they be able to clearly see which link has the focus?

#### Answer 2.2

Generally, in order to avoid accessibility inconsistencies it is important
to meet all the good practices we have learned so far.

Here is a list of things to consider in order to ensure accessibility is met:

- Avoid using words like `here` or `from this link` as link text, prefer to have
the link text contain information related to the actual link. This is more useful
for screen readers to understand.

```html
<a href="archlinux-2022.11.01-x86_64.iso">Download Arch Linux for x86_64</a>
```

- Make navigation links' boxes large for users with touchscreens.
- Hover and selection link colors and borders should be clear for users relying
only on their keyboard.
- Use proper block and inline tags to let screen readers understand the type
of content. E.g. the `<time>` can help screen readers announce dates and times
more reliably, not to mention it also helps with *SEO* (Search Engine Optimization).
- Use skip link navigation and utilize the `screen-reader-text` class to clarify
content that might be confusing for blind or otherwise disabled people.

## Question 3

Explain, in your own words, what the concepts of cascade, specificity and
inheritance are in the CSS language. Next, calculate the specificity of the
selectors in the following list (do not show only the final value, indicate
how to reach it step by step), and order them from highest to lowest specificity:

- ``.header #author``
- ``#author #nationality``
- ``#author + span::first-letter``
- ``p``
- ``footer > .featured``
- ``h1 + img[src*="UOC"]``

### Answer 3

Cascade: property of *CSS* which consists of applying selector rules as in a
cascade, i.e. from top to bottom. If you happen to repeat rules within the
same cascade layer, the last one is the only one that will be taken into account,
and the first one will be ignored.

Specificity: In cases where two or more rules target the same content, a conflict
occurs. Specificity in *CSS* helps resolve these conflicts by measuring which of
the conflicting selector has priority over the rest. The one with higher specificity
will be the one to affect the target content.

Inheritance: Some *HTML* elements can have children elements. Inheritance consists on
the ability of children element to inherit some of the properties of such element.
For example, you can set the global font size of color of a page under the `html`
selector, and elements in your page will base their font color or size depending on
that parent's value. Not all attributes can be inherited, and attributes can be manually
set to inherit or not inherit depending on our needs.

Order from lowest to highest specificity:

| No. | Selector | Identifier | Classes | Elements | Total Specificity | Explanation |
| :-: | :------: | :--------: | :-----: | :------: | :---------------: | :---------: |
| 1 | ``p`` | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0-0-1 | Single element |
| 2 | ``footer > .featured`` | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0-1-1 | One element and one standard class |
| 3 | ``h1 + img[src*="UOC"]`` | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0-1-2 | Two elements with one having a pseudo-class |
| 4 | ``#author + span::first-letter`` | 1 | 0 | 2 | 1-0-2 | One ID and an element which has a pseudo-element |
| 5 | ``.header #author`` | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1-1-0 | One ID and one class |
| 6 | ``#author #nationality`` | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2-0-0 | Two classes |

Ordering by specificity is quite easy. We have seen that identifiers, classes 
and elements all play a role in calculating specificity. To order selectors
based on specificity, we must take into account the following priority order:

```txt
identifier > class > element
```

Knowing this, if we look for example at the selectors `h1 + img[src*="UOC"]`
(0-1-2) and `#author + span::first-letter` (1-0-2), it is clear that the latter has higher
specificity, since an ID will always be prioritized over a class or an element.

## Explanation of the HTML and CSS entities used

This last part corresponds to the code part of this practical (2. Exercise).

### HTML entities: why have you chosen to use those specific tags?

The only *HTML* entity tag I have used is `&gt;`, to distinguish the "greater
than" sign `>`. I used it on the secondary page `ethe.html`.

### The CSS used must be explained. Why have you chosen those selectors and properties?

For *CSS* code I used various forms of selectors and attributes inside. Here
are the most notable ones:

- Initial values

```css
*,
*::after,
*::before
{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: inherit;
}

html
{
    font-size: 10px;
    max-width: 1200px;
    width: 80vw;
    font-family: Arial;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
```

This part set all base margin and paddings to zero by default, as well as forcing
the box sizing to be inherited. This allowed to easily fine-tune the structure of
the pages instead of using the browser's default settings which were often not ideal.
We also change the base font size from `16px`, to `10px`, because it makes it much
easier to convert `rem` values to `px` and vice versa (multiples of `10`).

The `html` selector formats the main display of the page. Specifically, we set
the maximum width of our pages to `1200px`. We set the width of the page
to `80%` of the view (`80vw`), and the left and right margins to
`auto` to center the content.

- Screen Reader Settings

```css
.screen-reader-text
{
    height: 0;
    width: 0;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: absolute;
}
```

I added this accessibility selector following the convention. A user relying on
a screen reader will have the opportunity to click on this invisible link and skip
the header navigation bar, effectively focusing on the content of the page.
This class can also be used to display extra content only meant for disabled users,
in order to clarify content.

- Header

```css
header
{
    position: relative;
    background-image: url(../img/header.jpg);
    background-position: left 25%;
    background-size: cover;
    border-radius: 1.5rem;
    height: 10rem;
}

h1
{
    width: 90%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    font-size: 3.5rem;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
}
```

The header includes the `h1` tag, which is centered with absolute positioning
with respect to the `header` block, thanks to it having relative positioning.
We set the proper background color and sizes, and center the text by first aligning
it on the middle. This makes the top left corner of `h1` appear on the middle, so
in order to center it properly we can reduce the `x` and `y` positions by `50%`.

- Navigation

```css
nav
{
    height: 6.5rem;
    background-color: #e9791a;
    border-radius: 1.5rem;
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
}

nav ul
{
    width: 100%;
    list-style-type: none;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

nav li
{
    display: inline-block;
    width: 6rem;
    text-align: center;
}

nav li:not(:last-child)
{
    margin-right: 0.6rem;
}

nav a
{
    display: inline-block;
    line-height: 3.5rem;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: white;
    border: 0.1rem solid #4433ff;
    background-color: #4433ff;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    text-decoration: none;
}

nav a:focus,
nav a:hover,
nav a:active
{
    outline: none;
    color: #e9791a;
    background-color: white;
}
```

Using the same absolute-relative positioning as with the header, we can arrange our
`ul` from the `nav` tag vertically. Then, we set the `li` and its inner `a` tags
to display as `inline-block`, in order to lay them out horizontally and have the
links' "click area" spread out to match the height of the whole box. Additionally,
we set the proper coloring for text and backgrounds depending on the state of the
link. We set right padding for every element of the list except the last one, since
we do not need the extra gap after the last button in our navigation bar.

- Author and subtitle

```css
.author
{
    font-size: 1rem;
    margin-top: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    text-align: right;
    margin-right: 0;
}

.author span
{
    color: #e9791a;
    font-weight: bold;
}

h2 ~ p
{
    text-align: justify;
    margin-top: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    margin-left: 9rem;
    margin-right: 11rem;
    font-size: 1.1rem;
}
```

Moving on below the navigation bar, we have the author which is set to
be aligned to the right. This is a special class I call `author`. In order
to color the name of the author, I used a span element. Then, we style the
paragraph below in a different way from other paragraphs. We select this
one paragraph by looking for siblings of `h2`. These documents only have
one level `2` header, so this particular selector does the job. This special
paragraph is narrower with justified text in italics.

- Borders around certain sections

```css
section.border
{
    margin-top: 1rem;
    border: 0.1rem solid black;
    border-radius: 1.5rem;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

The document is split into various sections inside a main `article` tag.
The website we have to replicate has some of the content with a rounded
border around it. I created a `border` class to add this specific border
to the right `section` tags.

- Block Quotes

```css
blockquote
{
    position: relative;
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
    padding-top: 1rem;
    padding-left: 3rem;
    padding-right: 16rem;
}

blockquote::before
{
    position: absolute;
    content: open-quote;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    transform: translate(-65%, -25%);
    font-size: 4.5rem;
    color: #11b2e6;
}
```

Block-level quotes have a specific styling. First of all, they are indented
(defined in other *CSS* selector), and their text is narrower. Then, to add
the quotation mark at that place I had to use a similar absolute-relative
position, to ensure that the quotation mark appeared on the top left of the
quoted text.

- Description Lists

```css
dl
{
    margin-left: 7rem;
}

dd
{
    padding-left: 2.5rem;
    text-indent: -2rem;
    padding-right: 16rem;
    padding-top: 0.6rem;
    padding-bottom: 1rem;
    line-height: 1.5rem;
}

dt
{
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

Styling description lists was mostly trivial. After setting some padding
and changing the line height to replicate the model website, the main
challenge here was padding the first line of our `dd` elements more on the
left than every other line. I ended up setting negative indentations to
tackle this issue.

- Lists

```css
.list,
.list_nest1
{
    margin: 1rem 1rem 1rem 4rem;
}

.list_nest1
{
    list-style-type: square;
}

li.atom
{
    list-style-type: none;
}

li.atom::before
{
    content: "\269B";
    font-weight: bold;
    padding-right: 0.2rem;
}
```

To distinguish normal `li` elements from `nav li` elements, I
created specific classes for each type of list I needed. I
used the `list` and `list_nest1` classes to display normal
lists. I set both classes to leave a margin `4rem` on the left,
which creates the nested indentations I was looking for. I also
created the `atom` class which uses a special character for its bullet
points (an atom icon).

- Figures

```css
figure img
{
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: block;
    width: 45%;
}

figcaption
{
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

Our figure was overflowing other content and the caption was
not centered. To fix this, we simply set the `text-align=center`
for the caption, and set automatic horizontal margins for the image
and scale it down to about `50%`.

- Underline Variations

```css
span.underline
{
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-style: dotted;
}

h3 span.underline
{
    text-underline-offset: 0.3rem;
}
```

Some words in the text had a dotted underline. In the `HTML` code
I used `span` tags along with an `underline` class to identify them.
The second selector above is for a very specific case. Looking at the
guide image of the page `index.html`, I noticed that the dotted
underline was slightly below the solid underline from the `h3` tag.
To match the guide image, I set proper offset to the underline.

- Footer

```css
footer
{
    display: flex;
    height: 7rem;
    font-size: 1rem;
    overflow: hidden;
    color: white;
    background-color: #4433ff;
    border-radius: 1.5rem;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}

footer p
{
    text-indent: 0;
    margin: 0;
    margin-top: 0.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    width: 85%;
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    text-align: center;
}

footer a
{
    color: white;
}
```

For the footer I decided to use `flexbox`. It allowed for lots of
simple and 'flexible' ways to arrange the two paragraphs to fit in the
footer background. The rest was rather straightforward to tweak.
