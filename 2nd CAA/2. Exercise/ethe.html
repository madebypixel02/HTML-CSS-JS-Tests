            <p>The purpose of this study aimed to analyze the process of online collaborative problem solving (<span class="underline">CPS</span>) via brain-to-brain synchrony (<span class="underline">BS</span>) at the problem-understanding and problem-solving stages.</p>
            <section class="border">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Collaborative problem solving (<span class="underline">CPS</span>, hereafter) has become a prominent feature in 21st-century learning skills, and it is being researched across many domains. <span class="underline">CPS</span> involves two or more people working together to solve a problem. Such capabilities have been recognized as a crucial goal in education.</p>
                <p>Research has indicated that the <span class="underline">CPS</span> skill of team members affects the effectiveness of collaboration. Groups with at least one student with high <span class="underline">CPS</span> skills showed significantly better learning performance.</p>
                <p>In addition, education practitioners have particularly emphasized the need for building skills for remote collaborations, as teams have become distributed and as schooling or working from home has become the norm.</p>

                <h3>Research questions</h3>
                <p>Based on the literature, different <span class="underline">CPS</span> phases play different roles in the process of collaboration. In addition, developing a good solution heavily relies on individual students’ domain knowledge and <span class="underline">CPS</span> skills. <span class="underline">BS</span> is an effective indicator of interaction quality, which is proven to have a positive correlation with learning performance in lecturing but is rarely studied in <span class="underline">CPS</span>.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of <span class="underline">BS</span> in <span class="underline">CPS</span> to find a new effective indicator, and understand the collaboration process at different <span class="underline">CPS</span> phases and how <span class="underline">CPS</span> skills impact the collaboration process from the aspect of <span class="underline">BS</span>. The research questions include:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li class="atom">What are the characteristics of <span class="underline">BS</span> in online <span class="underline">CPS</span>?</li>
                    <li class="atom">What are the differences in <span class="underline">BS</span> between collaborative groups with different <span class="underline">CPS</span> skills?</li>
                    <li class="atom">What are the differences in group interaction and cognition between groups with different <span class="underline">BS</span> levels?</li>

                <h3>The differences in BS between collaborative groups with different CPS skills</h3>
                <p>At the problem-solving stage, three types of collaborative groups showed a significant difference in the level of <span class="underline">BS</span> in the brain activities including unconscious mind, memory, and perception. The following bands show significant results.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The problem-understanding stage
                        <ul class="list_nest1">
                            <li>Delta: LG &gt; HLG &gt; HG, only LG &gt; HG and HLG &gt; HG were significant</li>
                            <li>High beta: HG &gt; HLG &gt; LG, only HG &gt; LG and HLG &gt; LG were significant</li>
                            <li>High gamma: HG &gt; HLG &gt; LG, only HG &gt; HLG and HG &gt; LG were significant</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The problem-solving stage
                        <ul class="list_nest1">
                            <li>Delta: LG &gt; HLG &gt; HG, only HLG &gt; HG was significant</li>
                            <li>High gamma: HG &gt; HLG &gt; LG, only HG &gt; LG was significant</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In Fig. 1, the high <span class="underline">CPS</span> skill student showed a higher level of beta-band intensity. That means the student was very focused and tended to be positive thinking. The student led the group discussions resulted in a higher <span class="underline">BS</span> level.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>This study analyzed students’ learning processes in the <span class="underline">CPS</span> activity from the aspects of cognitive neuroscience. First, <span class="underline">BS</span> shows as an effective indicator for observing group interactions during collaborative problem-solving and provides insights for teachers and researchers to further understand the <span class="underline">CPS</span> process. Second, the analytic results show common and unique characteristics at the problem-understanding and problem-solving stages.</p>
                <p>As an instructional approach, a <span class="underline">CPS</span> activity aims to get students engaged in the instructional activity and cultivate students’ <span class="underline">CPS</span> skills. This study provides evidence from aspects of cognitive neuroscience to support its effectiveness as an instructional approach in online learning. With the development of emerging technologies, more and more wearable devices can be used to track students’ physiological changes during the learning process. This study serves as a starting point in this endeavor. More research efforts in this area can be expected in near future.</p>
