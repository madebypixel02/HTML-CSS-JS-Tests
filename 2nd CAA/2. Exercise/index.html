            <h2>Google Scholar – Platforming the scholarly economy</h2>
            <p class="author">by <span >Jake Goldenfein</span> et al · September 29, 2022</p>
            <p>Google Scholar has become an important player in the scholarly economy. Whereas typical academic publishers sell bibliometrics, analytics and ranking products, <strong>Alphabet</strong>, through Google Scholar, provides free tools for academic search and scholarly evaluation that have made it central to academic practice.</p>
            <section class="border">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Bibliometrics have been a major part of academic publishing since the mid-20th century when Eugene Garfield developed citation indexing as a way to automate the organisation of scientific information.</p>
                <p>Despite long-held concerns, research evaluators and managers, such as funders and university hiring committees, continue to use metrics to quickly approximate research and researcher quality, and the commercial academic publishing industry continues to develop evaluative metrics and analytics as next generation products. Rather than add to the vast literature critiquing academic metrics and the metrification of academic work, this article interrogates the consequences of academic metrics that are provided by platform businesses like Alphabet through services like Google Scholar.</p>
                <p>Google Scholar is not simply a search interface. It has leveraged its system of citation counting into a tool that coordinates the scholarly economy. The service’s metrics drive the distribution, consumption and evaluation of both research and researchers.</p>

                <h3>The normative stakes</h3>
                <p>The primary ethical concerns exposed by our description of <em>Google Scholar</em> relate to concepts of academic autonomy. At one level, the evaluation of researchers and research centres has become central to the management of relationships between universities and their stakeholders — be they states or private funders.</p>
                <p>But within this weird patchwork of contradictory meanings, autonomy continues to do some meaningful normative work — especially in the context of evaluation. Indeed, it has always been central to academic autonomy that the work of academics be evaluated by other academics. According to Bourdieu, academic knowledge production can only be saved from its inherently contingent and political construction through transparency in the processes of evaluation, and through the pursuit of disinterested and peer-distributed forms of symbolic capital or credit. From here, Bourdieu makes the claim that:</p>
                <blockquote>The fact that [knowledge] producers tend to have as their clients only their most rigorous and vigorous competitors, the most competent and the most critical, those therefore most inclined and most able to give their critique full force, is for me the Archimedean point on which one can stand to give a scientific account of scientific reason, to rescue scientific reason from relativistic deduction and explain how science can constantly progress towards more rationality without having to appeal to some kind of founding miracle… The closure upon itself of the autonomous field constitutes the historical principle of the genesis of reason and the exercise of its normativity.</blockquote>
                <p>The use of metrics for evaluation, provided by any entity, raises complex issues. As noted above, there is no essential or inherent relationship between impact (defined by metrics) and quality. Metrics often smooth over geographic and disciplinary considerations, disconnecting those indicators from the real contexts of academic work.</p>

                    <h3>From <span class="underline">JIF</span> to Google Scholar citations</h3>
                <p><em>Google Scholar</em> launched in 2004, the same year that <strong>Elsevier</strong> launched rival bibliometrics platform <em>Scopus</em>. Beginning in 2006, citation counts were included in search results. The scholar profiling service, <em>Google Scholar Citations</em>, was launched in 2011. Citation counting drives both search and scholar profiles in different ways, and we argue that it has become a new unit of value for coordinating the scholarly economy, albeit in a manner different from <span>JIF</span>. While <span>JIF</span> quite explicitly shifted research priorities and visibility around inclusion in the <span>SCI</span>, <em>Google Scholar</em> is much more granular and totalizing in its shaping of research and researcher visibility according to citation count.</p>

                    <dt>SEARCH</dt>
                    <dd><em>Google Scholar</em> search scans its index of scholarly documents and provides results according to relevance ranking.</dd>
                    <dt>PROFILES</dt>
                    <dd>The researcher profile interface <em>Google Scholar Citations</em>, launched in 2011, the same year as <em>Microsoft Academic</em>’s metrics service (which closed in 2021). Scholar profiles are automatically generated in <em>Google Scholar</em>, but can be edited by scholars. To edit a profile, the author is required to have a personal or university-provided <strong>Google</strong> account.</dd>
                    <dt>USER EXPERIENCE</dt>
                    <dd>With <em>Google Scholar</em>, accessing scholarly work and scholar profiles becomes part of the native internet browsing experience.</dd>
                    <dt>OPEN ACCESS</dt>
                    <dd>A third <em>Google Scholar</em> dynamic that challenges certain academic politics and ethics is how it has leveraged “open access” publishing to make itself a new gatekeeper in the scholarly world.</dd>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p><em>Google Scholar</em> does not have a monopoly on opacity. There is a dearth of transparency and accountability across the now numerous tools for evaluation and ranking. <em>Google Scholar</em> is not the only bibliometrics platform demonstrating these features or causing these issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Google</strong>’s ambitions in education are vast. Unquestioned reliance on such opaque measures in hiring, promotion and tenure committees, let alone decisions about what to read and who can speak, displace academic autonomy. If the academy cannot develop an accountability relationship with <em>Google Scholar</em>, it must find other ways to meet its own obligations.</p>
